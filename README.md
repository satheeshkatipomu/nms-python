Non Max Suppression:
Non-Max Supression (NMS) is a technique used to select one bounding box for an object if multiple bounding boxes were detected with varying probability scores by object detection algorithms(example: Faster R-CNN,YOLO).

NMS is implemented in this notebook using two methods
1) Python using numpy in vectorized approach. 
2) Using tensorflow builtin function.

Requirements to run this notebook:
1)Python3
2) Numpy
3) Tensorflow
